      "I'm Camilo Diaz. A junior full-stack developer, IT Student and former Chef. I have a true passion for programming and am genuinely motivated by challenges and learning new skills that help me grow personally and professionally. This has sparked my curiosity and drive to embark on a new career in technology-software development.",
      "I've recently finished a contract with Accenture where I work on the improvement of myBubby, an automation tool for inter-company communications, engagement and information gathering that reaches >510K users globally.",
      "Before that, I had a successful 10-year-long career in hospitality where I worked all my way up from Commis Chef to Head Chef. In that time I developed many valuable soft skills like problem-solving, attention to detail, team-building and many more! that have already helped me a lot as a programmer."
